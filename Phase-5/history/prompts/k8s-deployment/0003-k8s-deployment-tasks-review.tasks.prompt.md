## Prompt

--title "K8s Deployment Tasks Review" --stage tasks --feature k8s-deployment

## Response snapshot

Reviewed the existing implementation tasks for Phase IV: Local Kubernetes Deployment. Confirmed that all tasks are comprehensively generated across 7 phases with proper user story alignment, correct format, and executable structure. Tasks cover containerization, Helm chart creation, Kubernetes deployment, and validation as specified.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Validated that all implementation tasks are complete and ready for execution
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/001-k8s-deployment/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute the deployment tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: All required tasks were already generated during the planning phase

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - the tasks were already complete and well-structured
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks follow correct format and align with user stories
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
